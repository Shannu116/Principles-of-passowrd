# Password Security Guidelines

## Overview
Strong passwords are essential to protect accounts and sensitive data from unauthorized access.  
This guide explains how to create secure passwords and why complexity matters.

## Password Requirements
- Length **more than 8 characters** (recommended: **10+ characters**)
- Include **at least one special character**
- Include **at least one number**
- Use a mix of **uppercase and lowercase letters**
- **Do NOT** use personal information such as:
  - Date of birth or years
  - Pet names or parentsâ€™ names
  - Mobile numbers
  - Vehicle names
  - Place or area names

## Why Complexity Matters
Complex passwords are harder to guess:
- **Longer passwords** increase the number of possible combinations.
- **Mixed characters** (letters, numbers, symbols) expand the search space.
- **Avoiding personal info** prevents targeted guessing using public or known data.
- This greatly slows down brute-force, dictionary, and social engineering attacks.

**Tip:** Use a password manager to generate and store complex, unique passwords for every account.
